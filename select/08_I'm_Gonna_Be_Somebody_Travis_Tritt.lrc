[00:13.15] Bobby played his guitar on the harder side of town
[00:19.17] Where it's hard for a poor boy to find the money
[00:25.12] He had dedication, he had the heart and soul
[00:31.71] Somehow knew he was born to play
[00:47.71] 
[00:38.01] People said get a real job support your family
[00:44.24] 'Cause there's no future on the road your takin'
[00:50.56] But he never said a word, the dreamer just kept on
[00:56.82] Late at night you could hear him say
[01:00.72] (He'd say)
[01:05.72] 
[01:02.93] I'm gonna be somebody
[01:09.52] One of these days I'm gonna break these chains
[01:15.57] I'm gonna be somebody someday,
[01:21.02] You can bet your hard-earned dollar I will
[01:42.02] 
[01:31.83] The road was a struggle, took him ten years to the top
[01:37.43] And now he's number one on the stage and the radio
[01:43.78] Still he can't believe how people come from miles around
[01:49.35] When it seems like only yesterday when he would say
[02:14.85] 
[01:56.59] I'm gonna be somebody
[02:02.94] One of these days I'm gonna break these chains
[02:08.99] I'm gonna be somebody someday,
[02:14.37] You can bet your hard-earned dollar I will
[02:35.37] 
[02:34.38] Bobby played his hometown, one full moon August night
[02:40.28] When He heard a voice in the front row singin
[02:46.40] It was a sandy-haired River boy with same ole hungry eyes
[02:52.43] He Looked up at Bobby and said
[03:07.43] 
[02:59.37] I'm gonna be somebody
[03:05.76] One of these days I'm gonna break these chains
[03:11.86] I'm gonna be somebody someday,
[03:17.11] You can bet your hard-earned dollar I will
[03:38.11] 
[03:21.44] You know i will yeah yeah
[03:33.94] 
[03:24.52] I'm gonna be somebody
[03:30.47] One of these days I'm gonna break these chains
[03:36.91] I'm gonna be somebody someday,
[03:41.95] You can bet your hard-earned dollar I will
[04:02.95]
